"Each folder contains the custom scripts that are associated with various Python-based tools that were employed for baseline comparisons in the research paper titled 'scaLR: A Low-Resource Deep Neural Network-Based Platform for Single-Cell Analysis and Biomarker Discovery.' These scripts facilitate the execution of different computational methods, enabling comprehensive performance evaluation and benchmarking of scaLR against established frameworks in terms of accuracy, resource efficiency, and scalability.
